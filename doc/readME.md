##README
This application is meant to serve as motivation to practice healthy habits and further one's goals. We designated tasks to get points; these points can then be traded in for prizes. Similar to buying prizes with earned tickets at an arcade. My partner and I are also using this application to save money, because we are not allowed to buy another outside of these prizes. Adjusting tasks and prizes on a monthly basis will allow us to focus on what furthers our goals and focuses our attention on spending money on what we really want.

How is this going to work? What functions will be in this application?
It should have an inviting look that makes you want to be sedulous in your attempt to earn prizes.
Prizes will be display in circle (later iteration is to have different sized circles based on prize tiers), when you hover over the prize image it will fade in a black backgroun with white text (prize point cost).
In the upper left we want an entry field with a searchable drop list (i.e. user types "read" and in the drop down list you should see tasks like "read a book chosen by partner = 30 points", "read a book you own = 20 points", or "read a library book = 17 points"). When you find your task that you completed you can submit and display a confirmation window in which you choose which user to add the points to. Each user will have a sum of points, or tickets, when you want to buy a prize you can click on that prize and it will pop up a confirmation to see which user is buying the prize then it will subtract the points from your point total. If you don't have enough points return error message. Next to entry field there should be a question mark that the user can click to display point charts for both tasks and prizes.Should also have access for user to see what their personal point total is.
