Prize Counter
=========
## Why did I decide to make this application?

This application is meant to serve as motivation to practice healthy habits and further one's goals.

We designated tasks that are meant to be about developing healthy habits or actively pursuing happiness. We can then do these tasks to earn tickets. The tickets can then be spent on prizes. The prizes are things that my partner and I want.

Some of the prizes are things that we regularly spend money on. In effort to save money, my partner and I decided these prizes are the only way to buy something outside of the essentials.

We have planned to adjust tasks and prizes on a monthly basis to stay engaged. This allows us to focus on what furthers our goals and focuses our attention on spending money on what we really want.

### Design Plan 
* It should have an inviting look that inspires you to work hard to earn prizes.
* Prizes will be display in circle (later iteration is to have different sized circles based on prize tiers), when you hover over the prize image it will fade in a black background with white text (prize ticket cost).
* In the uper left, there will be a drop-down list with the task on corresponding ticket value. 
* When you find the task that you completed you hit submit to display a confirmation window in which you choose which user to add the tickets to. 
* Each user will have a sum of tickets. Click on a prize to display a confirmation window. This window is where you choose the appropriate user. Once confirmed, it will remove the equivalent tickets from your total. 
* If you don't have enough tickets return error message. 
* Next to entry field there should be a button that displays ticket charts for both tasks and prizes.
* User should have access to their personal ticket total.
